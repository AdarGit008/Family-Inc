## Now

**v1 is live and accepted** (since 2026-06-13, tagged `v1-live`): the morning WhatsApp digest, the weekly briefing, the dashboard write-back loop, and the group summarizer all run unattended on the appliance. The **property tracker** is live (Yad2 on-box + Madlan via Apify). The summarizer runs on **DeepSeek**. **Finance ingestion (M6)** is the current build — the repo half is done; the appliance step is next. Two summarizer-review items are **gated** until ~2026-06-20 (they need a week of live classifier output to judge).

**✅ Audit fix lane — Brief 1 (blocker + 7 majors), landed 2026-06-18** (from the 2026-06-18 full-project audit in `reviews/`): bridge 1:1 chats are now **log-only, no ack** (B1, SPEC §7.4); the candle-lighting line fires on **erev-chag** too (B2); **criticals pierce mute** while non-critical rules are suppressed in muted groups, closing the budget-bypass (B3, SPEC §7.3); LLM privacy reconciled **provider-agnostic** (B4, SPEC §8.6/§8.7); finance gap-fill **chunk-loops** so a large first import is fully categorized (B5, M6); `deploy.sh` installs the **finance Node deps** + restores `--frozen` (B7, M6 — unblocks M6.2); the weekly briefing carries the **ENGINEERING §8 self-report line** (B6); the dashboard offline queue **caps at 50 with a one-shot warning** (B8). Tests green (350). **Brief 2** (10 gaps + minors + disputed) remains open. The fix touched privacy/delivery/budget → the `review.py` gate **ran 2026-06-18** (DeepSeek; `reviews/review_milestone_2026-06-18_16-41.md`): B1/B4/B5/B7/B8 affirmed; one false-positive defended (the mute short-circuit already follows the critical check), `chag_candles` window widened to +5d (Applied), and the dashboard-recurrence-bump finding routed to **Brief 2 GAP-4** (Open — pre-existing, out of lane).

**🔵 Brief 2 (small fixes) — Lane A + Lane E canon-hygiene landed 2026-06-18.** Lane A (finance hardening, M6-critical): GAP-1 `Dining`→`Dining out` aligned + a guard test pinning `rules.vocab ⊆ budget` (Fees/Income/Shopping held as a tracked allow-list **pending Shanee's budget-vocab migration** — the authority); finance-ingest#3 distinct in-batch-dup counter; OTP "interactive" promise scrubbed to truth (decision #1); fixed 45-day window doc'd (decision #2); Node pin bumped to ≥22.13 (the lib's real floor); GAP-6 `data_only` caveat + tests-quality#3 comment; seeds/README documents the committed rules CSV. Lane E hygiene: `Haiku`→DeepSeek docstring, ENGINEERING boundary-rules wording, 7-timers, finance-timer/SPEC consumer wording, D-NN sweep, BACKLOG Hebcal-line correction, `FINANCE_PLAN.md`→`Archive/`.

**✅ Lane S (publish/privacy safety) — landed 2026-06-18.** Audited all 18 tabs of the committed `Family_OS.xlsx`: **confirmed synthetic by construction** — no real emails (all `example.com`), phones, Teudat-Zehut (`000000000`), JIDs, or account numbers; the only real identifiers are the principals' first names `Adar`/`Shanee`, which are **accepted-public by design** (owner-routing tokens `OWNER_TO_RECIPIENTS`, Settings UserMap, CLAUDE.md roles, git author) — so GAP-5's feared real-PII leak was unfounded. Added **`tests/test_seed_safety.py`** (the dedicated check — fails CI if any high-severity PII is ever pasted into the seed) and documented in `publish_paths.txt` why the binary seed is kept-at-HEAD-and-guarded rather than history-stripped. deploy-systemd#4: `publish.sh` gauntlet now verifies `regex:` redaction rules (PCRE) instead of silently skipping them. Tests 355→357. **Review gate ran** (DeepSeek; `reviews/review_spec_2026-06-18_19-02.md`): core decisions affirmed; Applied — seed-safety test hardened (config sanity-check so it can't pass vacuously + Unicode-domain email detection) and `publish.sh` no-PCRE failure made actionable; Defended the O(N·M) re-grep + the "rewrite gauntlet in Python" alternative (fail-loud suffices); a full seed-recovery script left as a deferred nicety (the test already fails loud + names the recovery command).

**🔵 Lane B (robustness seams) — partial, 2026-06-18.** Landed the bounded outbox-integrity cluster: **outbox-budget#1** — the budget ledger now writes atomically (tmp+replace) and reads **fail-CLOSED** (a corrupt ledger reads as cap-reached → alerts defer, never flood; loud for the operator); **outbox-budget#2** — an `fcntl` lock around the ledger read-modify-write so concurrent senders can't double-spend the 2/day cap; **GAP-10** — the bridge's `processOutbox` got per-row try/catch (one failed `sendMessage` no longer abandons the rest of the batch; transient failures retry, only terminal sent/refused suppress); **GAP-8** — the multi-timer Sheet race documented as accepted (SPEC §8.3). Tests 357→358. **GAP-2 (stamp-after-deliver — the [high] silent-loss path) + outbox-budget#3 (pop-deferred-after-confirm) DEFERRED to a focused pass**: it changes the delivery contract (when "Sent" is written) and a bounded in-run wait risks duplicate digests if bridge latency ever exceeds the window — the correct design is a **cross-run reconcile** (stamp whenever the bridge eventually confirms via `whatsapp_sent.jsonl`), which deserves careful tests + the review gate, not a rushed tail-of-session change. Also deferred in Lane B: GAP-3 (JSONL rotation), bridge-node#2 (bridge scope-guard test harness).

**Deferred** (next sessions): **Lane B remainder** (GAP-2 + budget#3 cross-run reconcile, GAP-3, bridge-node#2 — review-triggering), Lane C (dashboard), and Lane E's code-correctness + test-gap items (digest >30d flag, derive_rule, property-apify, OVERDUE-overflow test, reply_handler stub flags, the deferred "budget is biting" line — decision #3).

## Shipped

- **Keystone loop** — reminders engine (07:25) → daily digest (07:30) → WhatsApp, with dashboard write-back, the outbox budget chokepoint, quiet hours, and the offline-write tombstone guard.
- **Weekly briefing** (Sat 21:00) — deterministic template, the system self-report, and a classifier-accuracy section. *(The candle-lighting Hebcal line is the daily digest's, not the weekly briefing's.)*
- **WhatsApp summarizer** — 5 hard rules + DeepSeek (with keyless keyword fallback), per-group routing, critical-keyword bypass.
- **Daily digest is partner-symmetric** — both adults briefed every day; the empty-handed adult gets the quiet-day line + shared sections, budget-free.
- **Property tracker** — saved-search scrape (headed Chromium under Xvfb) + Apify secondary (backup + gap-fill, primary always wins), silent `Property-Listings` landing + morning digest section.
- **Delivery hardening** — email (SMTP) fallback when the bridge is silent >24h, fail-flag → next-digest reporting, transport logging; email days count as degraded, not green.
- **Go-live + publication** — VPS provisioned, Baileys paired (7.x/ESM), GitHub Pages + PWA pinned to both phones, repo history rewritten clean and made public.
- **Classifier-accuracy surface** — `accuracy_review.py` re-derives each ALERT's rule from persisted Inbox fields (no schema change); a compact pulse folds into the weekly briefing.

## In progress — M6 finance ingestion

Banks + cards, categorized + trends, delivered silently. Read-only logins permitted on the appliance; "no money movement" unchanged. Full contract: `SPEC.md` §12.2.

- ✅ **M6.1 — repo port + schema (hermetic, no appliance).** `automation/finance/scrape.js` (read-only login → CSV) + `finance_ingest.py` (CSV → normalize → Txn-ID dedup → `lib/sheet`: append `Finance-Transactions`, upsert `Finance-Accounts`). Finance tabs standardized to `Finance-Budget`/`Finance-Accounts`/`Finance-Transactions`; `Category`/`Cat-Source` ship present-but-blank (the budget `SUMIFS` keys on the Category column position). `family-finance.{service,timer}` + provision wiring. Tests green; no live bank contact.
- ⬜ **M6.2 — appliance deploy + first live auth (the "VPS hour").** Place `bank_creds.json` (mode 600); rename the 3 live-Sheet tabs to the full names; Mizrahi first → verify CSV→Sheet roundtrip live → Max + Cal (OTP once each — the headless scraper has no interactive prompt; the operator re-runs the unit once the challenge clears); enable the timer. **Runbook: `deploy/FINANCE.md`.**
- ⬜ **M6.3 — consumer wiring + close.** Briefing Money section + dashboard Money drawer read live; the >35d stale-import warning fires. Acceptance = the first real monthly review (~30 days in).
- 🔵 **M6.4 — analysis layer.** *Repo half built + tested (2026-06-18).* The on-box rules engine (`automation/lib/categorize.py` + committed `seeds/14_Finance_Category_Rules.csv`) populates `Category`/`Cat-Source` at ingest; DeepSeek gap-fills the rules-miss remainder (description + amount only, §8.6). The briefing Money section gained per-category spend + month-over-month (the dashboard drawer reads the same tab — M6.3). **Reconciliation (the build-note landmine, resolved):** budget actuals now `SUMIFS` with a **text-prefix wildcard** on the ISO-text Date (`<yyyy-mm>&"*"`), not a serial `DATE()` window that read ₪0 — chosen over `USER_ENTERED` (which would coerce `Txn-ID`/`Account` and break dedup); the append stays RAW. Seed formulas updated + a regression test pins the form. **Gated to M6.3 (live):** apply the same formulas to the live `Finance-Budget` tab and verify actuals go non-zero on the first real month. **PROVISIONAL** category vocab until Shanee's budget migration firms it up. Silent delivery; no anomaly detection.
- ⬜ **Parallel (Shanee).** Budget migration — her manual budget → `Finance-Budget`; gives the actuals a target and defines the category vocab the rules engine maps to.

## Gated — summarizer review (opens ~2026-06-20, needs ≥1 week live)

- ⬜ **First real classifier-accuracy run + false-positive cleanup** — run `accuracy_review.py` over a full week of live DeepSeek output; narrow any over-firing keyword patterns.
- ⬜ **External milestone review on the live system** — folds in the property lane's review too.

## v1.1 candidates (unordered — pick after v1 is boring)

- **Reply parsing** (done/snooze via WhatsApp) — the bridge already **logs** 1:1 replies from the two adult JIDs to `replies.jsonl` (no ack — B1); `reply_handler.py` exists (already on `queue()` with `wa-{msg_id}` ids). Remaining: consume those logged replies — port `reply_handler`'s Sheet writes to `lib/sheet`, resolve LID-addressing (`msg.key.remoteJidAlt`) so replies aren't dropped, reinstate the reply footer, and a PO call on kinds (solicited acks would otherwise consume the unsolicited budget).
- **AI-written weekly briefing** — the briefing is template-only by design; wiring LLM prose needs a privacy call (whole-Sheet context → DeepSeek) with Shanee. Pair it with a content review of the template.
- **Inbox-append trigger** for the classifier (inotify on `inbox.jsonl`) — sub-hour critical latency without changing the hourly digest cadence.
- **Machine-measured classifier FP rate** — a human-mark channel (an Inbox `review` column or a dashboard control) to replace the by-eye accuracy read.
- **Apify monthly result-counter cap** — a programmatic ≤₪120/mo backstop for the property secondary source (today bounded only by per-search/per-day calls + item caps).
- **">₪500 single charge" finance alert** — an explicit PO call; it's an alert path that brushes the killed anomaly lane, so deferred deliberately.
- **External uptime ping** (healthchecks.io dead-man) — closes the silent hard-VPS-down gap.
- Google Calendar connector → `Calendar-Events`; iCloud → GCal ICS subscribe; a Reminders `Priority` column + bulk-done; a Hebrew chrome-string completion pass.

## Frozen lanes 🧊

*Frozen = the script lives in `attic/`, unmaintained. Unfreeze = the stated condition holds AND v1 has been stable for 30 days.*

| Lane | Unfreeze condition |
|---|---|
| Pediatric milestones | the Health tab is actively maintained |
| Goal coaching | the Goals tab is updated weekly for a month (proves the habit) |
| PDF→event, receipt OCR, voice capture, Gmail bill parser, Maccabi forwarders | per-item PO request, one at a time |

**Killed** (not frozen — gone from the board): anomaly / subscription detection. A keyword categorizer, also once killed, returns only in bounded form as the on-box finance rules engine (M6.4).
