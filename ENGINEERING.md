# Family Inc. — Engineering Handbook

*How the system is built, tested, deployed, and operated. v2.0 · 2026-06-17.*
*Contracts live in `SPEC.md`; this is the "how". If they disagree, `SPEC.md` wins and the disagreement is a bug.*

```

Boundary rules (convention, reviewer-checked — no CI enforces them yet): scripts never define a utility that belongs in `lib/` (no redefining `to_date`/`fmt_money`). Each external-site touch is the sole, named function in its own module — the bridge listener, finance `scrape.js`, `property_scrape.py`, `lib/apify.py`, and `hebcal_client.py` — never scattered ad-hoc. Nothing outside `lib/sheet.py` constructs a gspread client. Nothing outside `lib/llm.py` imports an LLM SDK. Nothing outside `lib/outbox.py` reaches a human.

## 2. Toolchain

| Layer | Choice | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Python | 3.12 + **uv** | `uv sync --frozen` on the box; lockfile committed; appliance path is `uv run --frozen` |
| Key deps | gspread, google-auth, anthropic, pytest, requests | additions need a one-line justification in the commit body |
| Node | 22 LTS, plain npm | bridge + finance scraper only; `npm ci --omit=dev`; lockfiles committed. The `engines` floors are the real minimums (bridge ≥20.11, finance ≥22.13); `provision.sh` installs 22 LTS |
| Browser | per-lane Chromium | **Playwright Chromium** (property; ephemeral `uv run --with playwright`, headed under `xvfb-run`) + **Puppeteer Chromium** bundled by `israeli-bank-scrapers` (finance; daily headless). The one-time `--auth` device-trust login is headed under xvfb+x11vnc, persisting a per-provider profile under `/var/lib/family-inc/finance/profiles/`, mode 700 — but **x11vnc is NOT installed by `provision.sh`** (it installs xvfb+xauth only); the operator adds x11vnc when first using `--auth`. Low urgency while cards are deferred. No chromium apt package is installed; each lane pulls its own browser, kept out of the uv lockfile |
| Scheduling | **systemd timers** | journald logs, `OnFailure=` hooks, `Persistent=true` catches missed runs after reboots |
| Dashboard hosting | GitHub Pages via Actions serving `main:/dashboard` | static, zero backend; the workflow generates the gitignored `config.js` from Actions secrets |
| Secrets | `/etc/family-inc/` mode 600 | `service-account.json`, `env` (DeepSeek/Anthropic keys, SMTP, Apify token), `recipients.json`, `property_searches.json`, `bank_creds.json` |

## 3. Configuration

- `automation/lib/config.py` loads secrets from `/etc/family-inc/env`. **All non-secret constants — alert-budget cap, tombstone window, quiet hours, digest size, lead/recurrence thresholds, inbox retention, model ids — are defined directly in `config.py`.** There is no `config.toml`.
- **No constant may be defined in a script.** This rule exists because the alert-budget cap was once defined twice with independent ledgers — exactly the class of bug it prevents.
- Dashboard config: `config.example.js` committed with placeholders; real `config.js` (Sheet ID, OAuth client id) gitignored and generated at deploy.

## 4. Coding standards

- Python: type hints on public functions; dataclasses for Sheet rows; no bare `except:` — catch narrowly, log with context, and **decide**: degrade (LLM paths) or surface (data paths). Silent swallowing is the bug class that once hid the mock/real boundary for two weeks.
- Every script is also a library: `main()` guarded, pure logic importable for tests.
- Logging: stdlib `logging` to stderr (journald captures); one structured CSV per domain in `logs/` for the self-reporting briefing lines.
- JS (dashboard): single-file vanilla discipline; state lives in the one `state` object; every Sheet write goes through `applyWrites()` and conforms to the SPEC §6.1 write contract.
- Hebrew in code: string literals fine, identifiers English. Message copy lives in template constants (`templates.py`), not inline f-strings, so `DESIGN.md` can review it.

## 5. The appliance (VPS)

`deploy/provision.sh` is idempotent and run as root once:

1. Create user `familyinc` (no sudo); `timedatectl set-timezone Asia/Jerusalem`.
2. Install uv + Node 22; clone the repo to `/opt/family-inc`; `uv sync --frozen`; `npm ci --omit=dev` in `bridge/` and `finance/`; install xvfb+xauth (the Playwright browser and Puppeteer's Chromium are pulled per-lane, not by an apt package).
3. Copy `deploy/systemd/*` → `/etc/systemd/system/`; `systemctl enable --now` the bridge service + all timers + the love-note + tunnel services (V3.7; install `cloudflared` and place `CLOUDFLARED_TUNNEL_TOKEN` first).
4. Place secrets in `/etc/family-inc/` by hand (never scripted, never copied off the box).
5. Pair Baileys: `systemctl stop family-bridge && node bridge/baileys_listener.js` once, scan the QR, restart. `bridge/state/auth_state/` is in the weekly backup — **after a VPS rebuild, restore it before re-pairing**; a fresh QR scan is the fallback, not the default. (A Baileys *major*-version bump is the one case that requires wiping `auth_state/` and re-pairing.)

Units (schedules are code — change them via PR, not on the box):

| Unit | Schedule | Runs |
|---|---|---|
| `family-bridge.service` | always-on, `Restart=on-failure` | Baileys listener + outbox sender |
| `family-finance.timer` | ~06:00 daily | bank scrape → ingest (live on Mizrahi/debit since 2026-06-19; cards Max/Cal deferred) |
| `family-property.timer` | 07:10 + 19:10 | property scrape → Sheet + digest section |
| `family-reminders.timer` | 07:25 daily | reminders engine (computes, doesn't send) |
| `family-digest.timer` | 07:30 daily | daily digest assembly → outbox |
| `family-summarizer.timer` | hourly, 24h | classifier — runs at night so **criticals** can fire any hour; ordinary alerts are still held 22:00–07:00 by the outbox |
| `family-weekly.timer` | Sat 21:00 | weekly briefing + classifier-accuracy section |
| `family-backup.timer` | Sun 03:00 | tar `bridge/state` + `logs/` → Drive via rclone |
| `family-lovenote.service` | always-on, `Restart=on-failure` | love-note endpoint (V3.7, SPEC §7.7) — localhost HTTP, fronted by the tunnel |
| `family-lovenote-tunnel.service` | always-on, `Restart=on-failure` | Cloudflare Tunnel → the love-note endpoint (token-managed; ingress set in the Cloudflare dashboard) |
| `family-lovenote-sweep.timer` | hourly | expire love-notes past 24h (belt-and-suspenders behind the server's lazy read-expiry) |

All timers: `Persistent=true`; `OnFailure=family-fail-flag@%n.service` appends the failing unit to `logs/fail.flag`. The next **delivered** digest reports it (a Hebrew line prepended) and clears the file; a flag still present on Saturday means digests aren't landing, and the weekly briefing says so.

**The love-note endpoint is the box's FIRST inbound HTTP listener** (everything else is an outbound timer/sender). It binds `127.0.0.1:8787` only; the Cloudflare Tunnel is the sole public path, so there is no port-forward and no home-IP exposure. It reads `Settings.UserMap` (the live Sheet, service account) and needs `FAMILY_INC_LOVENOTE_ORIGIN` (the Pages origin, for CORS) + `CLOUDFLARED_TUNNEL_TOKEN` in `/etc/family-inc/env`; a blank origin keeps the feature inert. Unlike the timers, the server is long-running — a deploy that changes its code needs an explicit `systemctl restart family-lovenote` (add it to the `familyinc` sudoers whitelist alongside `family-bridge`), since no timer picks it up.

## 6. Deployment

`deploy/deploy.sh` on the box:

```
git pull --ff-only
uv sync --frozen && (cd automation/bridge && npm ci --omit=dev) && (cd automation/finance && npm ci --omit=dev)
FAMILY_INC_SHEET_ID= uv run --frozen pytest -q   # red tests abort the deploy; running code is untouched
sudo /usr/bin/systemctl restart family-bridge    # whitelisted sudoers line
# family-lovenote restarted too when installed (guarded; long-running, not a timer)
```

Timers pick up new code automatically on the next fire (they exec scripts from the repo); the two **long-running** services — `family-bridge` and `family-lovenote` (V3.7) — are the exception and `deploy.sh` restarts both (the love-note restart is guarded, so it no-ops until the unit is installed). **Committed is not deployed** — a placed secret or a merged feature is inert until `deploy.sh` pulls it; confirm the box is at origin HEAD before declaring anything live. The `familyinc` user has exactly two sudo capabilities (restart `family-bridge` / `family-lovenote`, both restart-only), so a compromised script can't escalate.

**Pre-merge CI:** `.github/workflows/tests.yml` runs the hermetic pytest suite — including the seed-safety guard, the repo-wide PII-leak guard (`tests/test_repo_pii_guard.py` + the shared patterns in `lib/pii.py`), and the dashboard `config.js` smoke — on every push + PR to `main`, so a red commit can't merge. It gates **merge**, not the box: `deploy.sh` still runs the same suite on the appliance as the safety net before restarting the bridge (no `deploy.sh` change — the guards are plain pytest, so they ride the existing run). The job has no path filter (the PII guard scans the whole tree, so a leaked value in docs or config trips it too) and installs Node 22 so the `@requires_node` syntax-check tests run rather than skip.

Dashboard deploys are `git push` (Pages rebuilds in ~30s); the PWA on both phones picks up on next open. `sw.js` cache-busts on a version bump in `config.example.js`, mirrored into `config.js`.

## 7. Testing policy

These suites exist and stay green:

| Suite | Covers |
|---|---|
| `test_engine.py` | fire-reason matrix (overdue/lead/due-today), tombstone skip window incl. future-skew, recurrence bumps incl. Feb-29 clamp + Custom flagging, send-success stamping, Last-Sent rerun idempotency |
| `test_outbox.py` | budget ledger: 2-cap, critical bypass, briefing exemption, shared-ledger across senders, (id,target) dedup, quiet-hours hold |
| `test_summarizer.py` | the 5 hard rules, per-group routing incl. `none`→NEEDS-A-LOOK, keyword fallback without a key, dispatch through the outbox, Sheet-tab persistence + rerun dedup, JSON-parse tolerance |
| `test_render_golden.py` | weekly briefing + daily digest rendered against `tests/fixtures/*.md` golden files (byte-exact; update goldens deliberately) |
| `test_sheet.py` | row-parsing tolerance, schema-drift guard both directions + flag heal, batched write path incl. formula survival, Settings/UserMap, upsert |
| `test_property.py` | card parse/normalize, BlockedError, empty result, seen-diff, Sheet-dedup, digest section, junk rejection |
| `test_apify.py` | adapter field maps, backup vs gap-fill, primary-wins merge, per-search/per-kind cost gate, fail-loud-only-on-zero-usable, token-inert |
| `test_finance.py` | mock CSV → ingest → mock Sheet, Txn-ID dedup/idempotency, fail-loud on missing creds, account upsert preserving human fields, column-order pin |

**Tests are hermetic.** An autouse fixture blanks `FAMILY_INC_SHEET_ID`, the LLM keys, and the SMTP creds, so the appliance's `deploy.sh` pytest can never reach the live Sheet, a real model, or actually send email. LLM calls are never made in tests — `lib/llm.py` has a fake injected via env. The dashboard has a manual smoke checklist in `DESIGN.md` §9 (no JS harness — boring tech; revisit if `app.js` exceeds ~2,000 lines).

## 8. Observability

- journald per unit (`journalctl -u family-reminders`).
- `logs/reminders_log.csv`, `logs/llm_costs.csv`, `logs/outbox_ledger/`, `logs/delivery_log.csv` (transport per send-run: baileys | smtp | queued-stale). The classifier's per-message record lives on the `WhatsApp_Inbox` Sheet tab, not in `logs/`.
- Self-reporting: the weekly briefing carries one system line — "7/7 runs green · 41 messages classified · 2 tombstone skips (max age 1.4h) · ₪6.10 LLM spend". Any fail-flag, schema-drift, or stale heartbeat replaces it with a warning. The humans never check logs unless the briefing tells them to.
- External uptime ping (healthchecks.io free tier) is an accepted gap — a hard VPS-down is currently silent; listed v1.1.

**"No digest by 08:00" runbook** (the most likely 24h failure is a logged-out WhatsApp session on a healthy VPS):

1. Check email — if the digest arrived there, the bridge is down but the system is fine: SSH in, re-pair the QR (restore `auth_state/` first if post-rebuild).
2. No email either → the VPS is down: reboot from the provider console; `Persistent=true` timers fire the missed runs on boot.
3. Repeated same-week logouts → treat as a ban signal; invoke the `SPEC.md` §10 fallback decision.

## 9. Git & repo conventions

- `main` is deployable; small focused commits; imperative subjects; the body explains *why* when non-obvious.
- Sessions `git pull --ff-only` before any work (origin is the sync point between agents) and commit at session end (the leader pushes; Pages + `deploy.sh` consume `main`). Git operations run on the PO's machine, never in a sandbox.
- No long-lived branches — this is a two-committer repo (Adar + Claude-in-session).
- The Sheet schema only ever gains columns (additive, backwards-compatible); old rows without M/N/O are treated as never-tombstoned. Rollback at any point = `git revert` + redeploy.
- Tags: `v1-live` at acceptance, then `vX.Y` per milestone.

## 10. Review ritual

Reviews fire on **milestones**, not every session: a new spec, an architecture change, anything touching delivery/budget/privacy guarantees, and each milestone close. Mechanism: `automation/review.py` builds the prompt + attachment list; the reviewer is the best available external model (DeepSeek default; substitutions logged). A keyless local fallback is available via `--provider ollama` (₪0/run, on-box privacy). Findings are resolved in-session as Apply / Defend / Open, and any directional outcome is recorded. Tiny edits never trigger a review. On a milestone-closing session the gate runs **blocking inside the handoff chain** (`… && review gate && git commit && git push`) — a MAJOR finding stops the commit until resolved or explicitly overridden by the PO. A failed or truncated review never blocks a milestone: log it, proceed, note it in `BACKLOG.md`.

## 11. Definition of done (any work item)

Code merged with tests for its logic · constants in config · errors either degrade or surface (no silent paths) · contracts updated in `SPEC.md`/`DESIGN.md` if changed · `BACKLOG.md` status flipped · deployed and observed green once on the appliance.
